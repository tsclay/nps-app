### Takeaways

1. What went well?
   - Planned ahead to MVP and hit MVP.
   - Utilized Trello from day 1 using the Kanban method.
   - Maintained consistent communication via Slack and Zoom.
   - Resolving merge conflicts.

2. Biggest struggles as a group?
   - 40-minute Zoom timers, because Google Meet still sucks and we broke.
   - Resolving merge conflicts.
   - CSS styling as HTML content increased

3. Most useful tool?
   - node-fetch, because showing the API key on the front-end is a no-no.
   - morgan, for debugging server-code during setup.

4. Most surprising aspects of working as a group?
   - Git got more complicated. 
   - Bouncing between front-end and back-end and reading code someone else wrote. 

   - Putting together these many components took less time relative to if one person did it all.
